# MERN

This app is built using React on the front end, and powered by NodeJS,
Express, and MongoDB on the back end. With this app, you can easily
add and delete users, and order them according to different criteria,
including username, first name, last name, and age. The user-friendly
interface makes it easy to manage your users, and the back end ensures
the data is securely stored and can be retrieved quickly.
